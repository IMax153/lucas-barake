## Services

Let's now take a look at the third generic of the `Effect` type: `Effect.Effect<_, _, R>`

This channel is used for managing dependencies.

We've all been there, struggling with managing dependencies. The classic approach is to use function arguments:

```ts
const getUserById = (id: string, db: Db) => ...
```

However, this is incredibly tedious. Every single part of your application now needs to pass these dependencies in every invocation. What if `getUserById` internally calls another function that requires the same service?

You'll be drilling and drilling absolutely everywhere. This is a nightmare to maintain.

Fortunately, with Effect, everything changes. To create your services, all you need to do is extend `Context.Tag`:

```ts
import { Context } from "effect";

class CustomLogger extends Context.Tag("CustomLogger")<
  CustomLogger,
  {
    log: (...message: unknown[]) => void;
    logError: (...error: unknown[]) => void;
  }
>() {}
```

Notice how we invoke `Context.Tag` and pass in `"CustomLogger"`. This tag should be unique, as it will internally use a map where the key is the tag. This tag is assigned to the `_tag` property of the service.

We then pass in the interface for this service:

```ts
  {
    log: (...message: unknown[]) => void;
    logError: (...error: unknown[]) => void;
  }
```

This is the shape that our service must follow.

To use it, all we need to do is reference the service:

```ts
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const customLogger = yield* CustomLogger;

  customLogger.log("Hello, world!");
});
```

Let's now take a look at the type of `program`:

```ts
const program: Effect.Effect<void, never, CustomLogger>
```

As we can see, we get `void` for the success channel (we never return so it implicitly returns `undefined`), it doesn't error `never`, and requires the `CustomLogger`.

If we were to run this, we could get a type error (and a runtime error):

```ts
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const customLogger = yield* CustomLogger;

  customLogger.log("Hello, world!");
});

Effect.runSync(program); // Argument of type 'Effect<void, never, CustomLogger>' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Effect<void, never, never>'. Type 'CustomLogger' is not assignable to type 'never'.ts(2345)
```

`runSync` expects us to already provide all of the services before running it, as its requirements channel is `never`:

```ts
/**
 * @since 2.0.0
 * @category execution
 */
export const runSync: <A, E>(effect: Effect<A, E>) => A = _runtime.unsafeRunSyncEffect
```

## Providing a Service

To create your live implementation, all you need to do is ensure that your object satisfies the type of your service:

```ts
const CustomLoggerLive = CustomLogger.of({
  log: (...message) => console.log(...message),
  logError: (...error) => console.error(...error),
});
```

For this, we can just use `of`, which is a public property added when extending `Context.Tag`. It's just an identity function that ensures what you create corresponds to your service structure:

```ts
export interface Tag<in out Id, in out Value> extends Pipeable, Inspectable {
  // ...
  of(self: Value): Value
  // ...
```

This is just for type-safety, but you can omit it if you want.

Now, to provide the service, you just need to do is use `Effect.provideService`:

```ts
const program = pipe(
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const customLogger = yield* CustomLogger;

    customLogger.log("Hello, world!");
  }),
  Effect.provideService(CustomLogger, CustomLoggerLive)
);
```

The first argument of `provideService` is the `tag` (restricted to `Context.Tag<any, any>`), and the second one is the actual implementation.

>It's convention to use Live as a postfix to indicate that this will be your production implementation of the service and it's not meant to be used for testing, for example.

## Inferring the Service Type

If you want to infer the service type from the Live implementation, all you need to do is use `typeof` in the second generic argument when creating the service:

```ts
const CustomLoggerLive = {
  log: (...message: unknown[]) => console.log(...message),
  logError: (...error: unknown[]) => console.error(...error),
};

class CustomLogger extends Context.Tag("CustomLogger")<CustomLogger, typeof CustomLoggerLive>() {}
```

## Layers

What if a service requires another service?

You would probably do the following:

```ts
const UserRepositoryLive = {
  getUserById: (id: number) =>
    Effect.gen(function* () {
      const logger = yield* CustomLogger;

      if (id === 0) {
        logger.logError("User not found");
        return Effect.fail(new Error("User not found"));
      }

      logger.log(`Getting user with id: ${id}`);

      return { id, name: "John Doe" };
    }),
};

class UserRepository extends Context.Tag("UserRepository")<
  UserRepository,
  typeof UserRepositoryLive
>() {}
```

The problem with this approach is that you're leaking the dependencies to the actual service, rather than at its construction. That means whenever you want to use `getUserById`, you need to provide the service to the function. What if you have many other functions? Each one manages its own dependencies.

Obviously, just by providing the service when running it, you don't need to provide it independently for every single function, since that requirement will already be satisfied, but again, you are leaking each dependency to your service.

This is usually something you want to abstract and encapsulate within the construction of the layer itself, so your functions don't leak these dependencies.

For that, you can use a layer:

```ts
const makeUserRepositoryLive = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const logger = yield* CustomLogger;

  return {
    getUserById: (id: number) => logger.log(`Getting user with id: ${id}`),
  };
});

class UserRepository extends Context.Tag("UserRepository")<
  UserRepository,
  Effect.Effect.Success<typeof makeUserRepositoryLive>
>() {}
```

Now, `getUserById` is:

```ts
getUserById: (id: number) => Effect.Effect<void, never, never>
```

As you can see, it doesn't require anything.

**But** when constructing the layer, you need to provide the service:

```ts
const makeUserRepositoryLive: Effect.Effect<{  
getUserById: (id: number) => Effect.Effect<void, never, never>;  
}, never, CustomLogger>
```

As you can see, `CustomLogger` is a required dependency.
### Providing a Layer

To provide a layer, you first need to create the layer. What I like to do is create a public static property called `Live`:

```ts
class UserRepository extends Context.Tag("UserRepository")<
  UserRepository,
  Effect.Effect.Success<typeof makeUserRepositoryLive>
  >() {
  public static readonly Live = Layer.effect(this, makeUserRepositoryLive);
}
```

`Layer.effect` accepts two arguments:
1. The `_tag` which corresponds to `Context.Tag<any, any>`
2. The implementation which is an effect that must succeed with the shape of the service.

We can just use `this` to get the tag.

To provide it, all we need to do is use `Effect.provide`, which supports both the curried and uncurried forms:

```ts
const program = pipe(
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const customLogger = yield* CustomLogger;
    const userRepository = yield* UserRepository;

    customLogger.log("Hello, world!");

    const user = yield* userRepository.getUserById(1);
  }),
  Effect.provide(UserRepository.Live),
  Effect.provideService(CustomLogger, CustomLoggerLive)
);

Effect.runSync(program);
```

Notice how the order is important. Since the `UserRepository` requires the `CustomLogger` service, we need to first provide the repository, _and then_ provide the logger.
