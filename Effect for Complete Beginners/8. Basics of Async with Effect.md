Effect also provides another `run*` method:

`Effect.runPromise`

Similar to `Effect.runSync`, it takes an effect as its first argument and exposes a `Promise`.

It's important to note that Effect internally does not use async/await. Instead, Effect implements its own asynchronous model to handle errors as values and offer additional concurrency options, which we'll explore later.

Consider a scenario where we want to make a request using `fetch`, which returns a `Promise`. How can we use `await`? How do we map the error to the error channel of an Effect? The process is straightforward:

```ts
const fetchTodos = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const response = yield* Effect.tryPromise(() => fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos"));

  const todos = yield* Effect.tryPromise(() => response.json());

  return todos;
});

Effect.runPromise(fetchTodos); // Promise<unknown>
```

>Notice how there's no need to wrap the effect in a function, as `Effect.gen` is already lazy.

We use `yield*` with `tryPromise` because `tryPromise` is an Effect, and we need to flatten it:

```ts
export declare const tryPromise: {
  <A, E>(options: {
    readonly try: (signal: AbortSignal) => PromiseLike<A>;
    readonly catch: (error: unknown) => E;
  }): Effect<A, E>;
  <A>(try_: (signal: AbortSignal) => PromiseLike<A>): Effect<A, Cause.UnknownException>;
};
```

`tryPromise` has two overloads:

1. The first accepts an object with `try` and `catch` properties. `try` defines a promise that returns `A`, and `catch` receives the error from `try` and returns `E`, which is mapped to `Effect<A, E>`.
2. The second only receives the `try` callback. Effect handles the error and assigns `Cause.UnknownException` to the error channel: `Effect<A, Cause.UnknownException>`.

In our example, we're using the second overload, resulting in:

```ts
declare const fetchTodos: Effect.Effect<unknown, Cause.UnknownException, never>
```

When we `yield*` to `Effect.tryPromise`, it produces a blocking behavior, similar to `await`.

## Using the First Overload for More Specific Error Handling

We can use the first overload for more specific error handling:

```ts
const fetchTodos = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const response = yield* Effect.tryPromise({
    try: () => fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos"),
    catch: (error) => {
      console.error(error);
      return new Error("Failed to fetch todos");
    },
  });

  const todos = yield* Effect.tryPromise(() => response.json());

  return todos;
});
```

Now, `fetchTodos` has `Error` as a possible error in the error channel:

```ts
declare const fetchTodos: Effect.Effect<unknown, Error | Cause.UnknownException, never>;
```

## Handling Guaranteed Promises with Effect.promise

For promises that you are certain will not fail, Effect provides the `Effect.promise` function:

```ts
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const result = yield* Effect.promise(() => Promise.resolve(true));

  return result;
});

Effect.runPromise(program);
```

`Effect.promise` still results in a blocking behavior. The execution will wait until the promise resolves before proceeding to the next step in the generator function.
