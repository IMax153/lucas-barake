Effect provides a utility called `runSync`. It executes an `Effect` synchronously and returns the success channel `A`:

```ts
export const runSync: <A, E>(effect: Effect<A, E>) => A = _runtime.unsafeRunSyncEffect
```

So, we can pass in our `divide` function, since `divide` satisfies the type of `Effect<A, E>`:

```ts
const result = Effect.runSync(divide(1, 2));
result; // number
```

However, going back to its internal implementation, as we can see, it internally calls `_runtime.unsafeRunSyncEffect`. As the name suggests, it's **unsafe** because it should only be used for synchronous code:

```ts
/** @internal */
export const unsafeRunSyncEffect = unsafeRunSync(defaultRuntime)

/** @internal */
export const unsafeRunSync = <R>(runtime: Runtime.Runtime<R>) => <A, E>(effect: Effect.Effect<A, E, R>): A => {
  const result = unsafeRunSyncExit(runtime)(effect)
  if (result._tag === "Failure") {
    throw fiberFailure(result.effect_instruction_i0)
  } else {
    return result.effect_instruction_i0
  }
}
```

Now, if we `runSync` `divide`, we will see that the result is indeed of type `number`. However, since `result` is of type `number`, and not a union of its error channel (or something of the like), that means it will throw the error. To catch it, we can use a `try/catch` block:

```ts
try {
  const result = Effect.runSync(divide(1, 2));
  result; // number
} catch (error: unknown) {
  // ...
}
```

Unfortunately, this means `error` is now of type `unknown`. Now, the great advantage of using `Effect` is that we can just hover over `divide` and see that the type is `Effect.Effect<number, Error, never>`, so `error` in the `catch` block can be safely typed as `Error`.

>omit the absence of defects in the error channel, no need to overload the audience with more info

Fortunately, you can combine and chain multiple computations together using pipes:

```ts
divide(1, 2).pipe(
  Effect.catchAll((error) => {
    error; // Error
  }),
);
```

Alternatively, you can use the `pipe` function, which some find more readable:

```ts
pipe(
  divide(1, 2),
  Effect.catchAll((error) => {
    error; // Error
  })
)
```

The `catchAll` function will handle any error that occurs:

```ts
export declare const catchAll: {
  <E, A2, E2, R2>(f: (e: E) => Effect<A2, E2, R2>): <A, R>(self: Effect<A, E, R>) => Effect<A2 | A, E2, R2 | R>;
  <A, E, R, A2, E2, R2>(self: Effect<A, E, R>, f: (e: E) => Effect<A2, E2, R2>): Effect<A2 | A, E2, R2 | R>;
};
```

It has two overloads:

1. The first one takes a callback that receives the error `E` and returns a function that accepts `self` (the Effect to be treated).
2. The second one takes `self` as the first argument, followed by the error-handling callback.

In our example:

```ts
pipe(
  divide(1, 2),
  Effect.catchAll((error) => {
    error; // Error
  })
)
```

We're using the curried form (the first overload).

Now, going back to `catchAll`'s signature, we can see that the function expects its callback to return an `Effect`:

```ts
export declare const catchAll: {
  <E, A2, E2, R2>(f: (e: E) => Effect<A2, E2, R2>): <A, R>(self: Effect<A, E, R>) => Effect<A2 | A, E2, R2 | R>; // highlight f: (e: E) => Effect<A2, E2, R2> 
  <A, E, R, A2, E2, R2>(self: Effect<A, E, R>, f: (e: E) => Effect<A2, E2, R2>): Effect<A2 | A, E2, R2 | R>;
};
```

It takes a function that accepts `E` (the error of `self`) and returns another `Effect`, resulting in `Effect<A2 | A, E2, R2 | R>`.

This new Effect replaces the original `E` with `E2`, allowing error remapping. It returns a union of `A2 | A` because `catchAll` may or may not execute, depending on whether an error occurs.

Let's take this example:

```ts
const result = pipe(
  divide(1, 2),
  Effect.catchAll(() => Effect.succeed("hello"))
);

result; // Effect.Effect<number | string, never, never>;
```

If `divide` fails, we recover by returning `"hello"`. The result type is `number | string` because the operation might succeed (returning a number) or fail and recover (returning a string).

Now, once you're done composing your effects, you can run them:

```ts
const result = pipe(
  divide(1, 2),
  Effect.catchAll(() => Effect.succeed("hello")),
  Effect.runSync,
);

result // number | string
```

---

_As we can see, `Effect.runSync` can be used at the end of the `pipe`:_

```ts
export const runSync: <A, E>(effect: Effect<A, E>) => A = _runtime.unsafeRunSyncEffect
```

_It would be equivalent to doing this:_

```ts
const result = pipe(
  divide(1, 2),
  Effect.catchAll(() => {
    return Effect.succeed(null);
  }),
  (effect) => _runtime.unsafeRunSyncEffect(effect),
);
```
