We've learned that yielding an Effect in `Effect.gen` flattens the Effect. This means it extracts the success channel for you (allowing you to assign it to a variable, for example), while also extracting the error and requirements channels to the parent effect.

But how can we achieve this with pipes? What if we need to execute another Effect after the initial value? Or perhaps map over the success channel but perform another effectful computation?

## Using `flatMap`

For that, you can use `flatMap`:

```ts
const fetchUser = (
  id: number
): Effect.Effect<{ id: number; name: string }, Error> =>
  Effect.succeed({ id, name: `User ${id}` });

const fetchUserPosts = (userId: number): Effect.Effect<string[], Error> =>
  Effect.succeed([`Post 1 by User ${userId}`, `Post 2 by User ${userId}`]);

const program = pipe(
  Effect.succeed(1),
  Effect.flatMap((userId) => fetchUser(userId)),
  Effect.flatMap((user) =>
    pipe(
      fetchUserPosts(user.id),
      Effect.map((posts) => ({ user, posts })),
    )
  ),
  Effect.tap(({ user, posts }) => `${user.name} has ${posts.length} posts`)
);
```

In this example, `fetchUser` is an Effect. For demonstration purposes, we're using succeed with a mock user. In a real-world scenario, this might query a database, which would be an asynchronous operation. You would likely encapsulate the query in a `tryPromise`, or perhaps include additional logic such as checking a cache first. It could also potentially fail.

Since it's an Effect, if we were to just do an `Effect.map` we would get:

```ts
const fetchUser = (
  id: number
): Effect.Effect<{ id: number; name: string }, Error> =>
  Effect.succeed({ id, name: `User ${id}` });

pipe(
  Effect.succeed(1),
  Effect.map((userId) => fetchUser(userId)),
  (effect) => effect // Effect.Effect<Effect.Effect<{ id: number, name: string }, Error, never>, never, never>
);
```

As you can see, we don't flatten the Effect. Instead, we set the fetchUser's resulting effect to the success channel.

If you recall, this is akin to doing:

```ts
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  return Effect.succeed(1);
});

program; // Effect.Effect<Effect.Effect<number, never, never>, never, never>
```

We need to `yield*` the `Effect.succeed` to flatten it. The same logic applies with pipes when using flatMap.

## Introducing `flatMap`

What if you want a convenient "catch-all" method that flattens the Effect if it's an Effect, or if it isn't, keeps the value in the success channel?

For that, you can use `andThen`:

```ts
const fetchUser = (
  id: number
): Effect.Effect<{ id: number; name: string }, Error> =>
  Effect.succeed({ id, name: `User ${id}` });

const fetchUserPosts = (userId: number): Effect.Effect<string[], Error> =>
  Effect.succeed([`Post 1 by User ${userId}`, `Post 2 by User ${userId}`]);

const program = pipe(
  Effect.succeed(1),
  Effect.andThen((userId) => fetchUser(userId)),
  Effect.andThen((user) =>
    pipe(
      fetchUserPosts(user.id),
      Effect.map((posts) => ({ user, posts })),
    )
  ),
  Effect.tap(({ user, posts }) => `${user.name} has ${posts.length} posts`)
);
```

Again, you can use it as a substitute for `map`:

```ts
const result = pipe(
  Effect.succeed(100),
  Effect.andThen((val) => val * 2),
  Effect.andThen(() => "finished!" as const),
);

result; // Effect.Effect<"finished", never, never>
```
